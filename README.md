Project Description:

Which industries are booming? Where should your next investment be? With the rise of the ‘amateur investor’ and the availability of platforms enabling people to invest and sell stock in public companies, it’s never been a better time to understand the financial performance of companies across the globe! Using a PostgreSQL database we will be able to analyze information about unicorn companies worth over $1 billion! we will find out which industries have the highest average valuation and then zoom in on these to determine how many new unicorns have been produced annually between 2019 and 2021!
